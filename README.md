Project description:
	The objective of this project is using C ++ to implement the process scheduling algorithms, there are FCFS(First Come First Serve Algorithm), PS(Priority Scheduling Algorithm), SJF(Shortest Job First Algorithm), and HRRN(Hign Response Ration Next Algorithm), and the purpose of this project is to further understand the concept and meaning of various process scheduling algorithms. The challenge of this project to understand how the process will be scheduling in the modern computer system and use the algorithm to implement all of them.

Description and Instruction to reproduce:
	The program set up is very simple, just input all the requirements information of the processes, and then the program will calculate and display the result.
